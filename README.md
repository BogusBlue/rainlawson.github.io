## Hello
<img src="1699126763154.jpg" width="120"/>
 
My name is Rain Lawson, and I'm hoping to start a carreer in technology.

I graduated summa cum laude from Texas State University in 2022 with a B.S. in Computer Science. I followed up by continuing with graduate school, in which I worked with Dr. Martin Burtscher and his [Efficient Computing Laboratory (ECL)](https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~burtscher/research.html). Then, I worked for a time as a research and development software engineer for GeoSpatial Innovations.

I am now trying to pivot my carreer into the information technology field. I hope to leverage my knowledge of researching, software engineering, networking, and general computer knowledge to set up and fix systems (software or hardware), as well as helping others with any problems they may be having with their electronics. I thoroughly enjoy the troubleshooting process and hope to make a difference.

## Projects

### Lossless Parallel Image Compression Project
Developed along with Dr. Martin Burtscher's [Efficient Computing Laboratory (ECL)](https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~burtscher/research.html), this project was to create a novel lossless parallel image compressor. Parallelized in OpenMP and CUDA, the developed algorithm was compared against other common image and general compression algorithms. When compared to other image and file compressors, ours consistently had the highest throughput and maintained competetive compression ratios.

It got [presented](https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~burtscher/abstracts.html#DCC24a) at the 2024 Data Compression Conference.

### Computer Vision Machine Learning Project
Developed for a computer vision class, the goal of this project was to use MATLAB and machine learning principles to train a machine learning model to detect faces. Our project was successful in detecting faces in almost all images tested.
